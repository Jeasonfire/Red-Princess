A princess dressed in red with magical fire powers jumping around burning paper enemies.

Story
-----
A long time ago, before magic was purged from existence, there was a kingdom. The kingdom was ruled by a queen. The queen was a great ruler who was fortunate enough to rule the kingdom during such a golden age. The people were happy.  
The queen had a sister. A jealous sister. This sister tried to overthrow the queen one day; but alas, the sister failed. She ended up in the dungeons, filled with spirits in paper bodies as guards.  
Even after this, the sister didn't give up her plans...
